# ProjectPUBG

  Player Unknown Battleground is a survival game released 2017, and it was successful to bring a lot of users during early access season. Users in the game compete with others by farming items and surviving in the island. Due to the characteristics of the game, the game statistics like winning rate, killing rate is meaningful to the players, however, users can only check their statistics ingame when they logged in to the game. This causes information accessibility problem due to the authentication. 
  Therefore, We are trying to extract the information from the game so that users can check their rate outside of the game using the website I created.
